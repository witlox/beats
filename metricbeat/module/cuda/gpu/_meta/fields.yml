    `gpu` contains local GPU stats.
  fields:
    - name: gpus
      type: long
      description: >
        The number of GPUs present on the host. The non-normalized percentages will have a maximum value of `100% * cores`.
        The normalized percentages already take this value into account and have a maximum value of 100%.
    - name: gpu[number].type
      type: string
      description: >
        The GPU ProductName.
    - name: gpu[number].temp
      type: long
      description: >
        The current temperature of the GPU in degrees C.
    - name: gpu[number].fan
      type: long
      description: >
        The current speed of the GPU fan in RPM.
    - name: gpu[number].pwrdrw
      type: string
      description: >
        The current power usage in Watts.
    - name: gpu[number].pwrlim
      type: long
      description: >
        The current power limit in Watts.
    - name: gpu[number].perfst
      type: string
      description: >
        The current performance state for the GPU. States range from P0 (maximum performance) to P12 (minimum performance).
    - name: gpu[number].memtot
      type: long
      description: >
        Total frame buffer memory information. Reported total memory is affected by ECC state.
        If ECC is enabled the total available memory is decreased by several percent, due to the requisite parity bits.
        The driver may also reserve a small amount of memory for internal use, even without active work on the GPU. For all products.
    - name: gpu[number].memfree
      type: long
      description: >
        Free frame buffer memory information. Reported total memory is affected by ECC state.
    - name: gpu[number].memused
      type: long
      description: >
        Available frame buffer memory information. Reported total memory is affected by ECC state.
    - name: gpu[number].gpupct
      type: scaled_float
      format: percent
      description: >
        Percent of time over the past sample period during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU.
    - name: gpu[number].mempct
      type: scaled_float
      format: percent
      description: >
        Percent of time over the past sample period during which global (device) memory was being read or written.
    - name: gpu[number].gclock
      type: long
      description: >
        Current frequency of graphics (shader) clock in MHz.
    - name: gpu[number].mclock
      type: long
      description: >
        Current frequency of memory clock in MHz.
    - name: gpu[number].smclock
      type: long
      description: >
        Current frequency of SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) clock in MHz.
